Good for an instant handson-lab environment

## How to run locally

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 making/code-server 
```

The password should be output in the log message.

You can use a custom password as follows:

```
docker run --rm -e PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 8080:8080 making/code-server 
```

## How to push a code server to Cloud Foundry

### To Pivotal Application Service

Make sure your foundation allows to push a docker image

```
$ cf feature-flags | grep docker
diego_docker                                  enabled <--
```

Just cf push!

```
cf push code-server -o making/code-server -m 2g -k 2g --random-route
```

More than 4g would be better for the disk size if allowed.

You'll see your generated password with `cf logs code-server --recent`.

If you want to use a custom password:

```
cf set-env code-server PASSWORD yourpassword
cf restart code-server
```

### To Pivotal Web Services

The way to deploy a code server is as same as Pivotal Application Service above.
However in PWS the load balancer via `80`/`443` port does not support WebSocket, you have to use `8443` port instead.

So go to `https://code-server-<random-words>.cfapps.io:8443/login`.
After login with the correct password, you'll see `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` as you are redirect to HTTP (not HTTPS).

Change `http` to `https` in the url bar of the browser, then you'll see the welcome page :)

## How to build your own docker image

```
docker pull making/coder-server # good for caching
# Add your favorite CLIs to Dockerfile
docker build . -t <your-image-name>
```
